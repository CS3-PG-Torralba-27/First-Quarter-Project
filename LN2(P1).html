				<p> The Hunter is the first antagonist encountered in Little Nightmares II. He is the main antagonist of The Wilderness chapter. </p>
				<p> The Hunter is a large, humanoid monster with a somewhat stocky physique and a massive head covered by a burlap sack tied around his neck with twine, with a single eyehole where his right eye would be, topped with a brown Gatsby cap. The rest of the Hunter's outfit consists of a green overcoat, brown trousers, brown gloves, and black leather work boots. His coat is noticeably worn and crudely stitched together, with the seam of his right shoulder being the most threadbare, revealing a white cotton-like substance bulging out from between the stitches. This may either be the insulation of the Hunter's jacket, or an implication that the Hunter himself is filled with stuffing, similar to the rest of the taxidermy in his home. The Hunter also has heavy breathing, as seen when being idle. </p>
